            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>npleaÅ¿ing</hi> we believe to <hi>God</hi> himÅ¿elf; <hi>unpleaÅ¿ing</hi> to all meek, humble and peaceable ChriÅ¿tians; <hi>unpleaÅ¿ing</hi> to his <hi>quondam</hi> loving neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and friends of <hi>Aldermanbury; unpleaÅ¿ing</hi> to moÅ¿t of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwriters;</hi> and we conceive it will at laÅ¿t become an <hi>unpleaÅ¿ing</hi> diÅ¿courÅ¿e to M. <hi>Burton</hi> himÅ¿elf, when the judicious and impartiall Reader Å¿hall clearly and fully underÅ¿tand the true grounds and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es of his diÅ¿continuing to preach his <hi>CatechiÅ¿ticall Lecture</hi> in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermanbury;</hi> which before we come to declare, we deÅ¿ire the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take notice of the Title of the <hi>Narrative,</hi> which is, <hi>Truth Å¿hut out of doors:</hi> or, <hi>A brief and true Narrative of the occaÅ¿ion and manner of proceeding of Å¿ome of Aldermanbury PariÅ¿h, in Å¿hutting their Church-doors against me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Title M. <hi>Burton</hi> doth Å¿eem to aÅ¿Å¿ume to himÅ¿elf the name of <hi>Truth</hi> (which is a very high and Å¿acred <hi>Title</hi>) and to make the <hi>Å¿hutting</hi> of <hi>him</hi> out of doors, to be the <hi>Å¿hutting</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> out of doors: which how fit it is for any humble and Å¿elf-denying MiniÅ¿ter to Å¿peak of himÅ¿elf, we leave it to the Reader to judge.</p>
            <p>And beÅ¿ides, This Title layeth a very heavie charge upon the <hi>Church-wardens</hi> and others of <hi>Aldermanbury,</hi> as if they were now become enemies to the truth, as if they had Å¿hut the Church-doors upon truth, inÅ¿omuch as that it is cried up and down the Å¿treets of the City, <hi>Truth Å¿hut out of the doors of Aldermanbury,</hi> to the great diÅ¿paragement and defamation of us all; Å¿o great, as that we conceive it to be a high breach of the ninth Commandment, and we expect <hi>Reparation.</hi> And as he <hi>hopes in this his Narative that</hi> M. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy will finde juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e publikely to confeÅ¿Å¿e</hi> at his next <hi>day of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113328:3"/>Let us be aÅ¿hamed and confounded,</hi> Å¿o he muÅ¿t give us leave to Å¿ay, that we expect, and that more juÅ¿tly the like from him.</p>
            <p>EÅ¿pecially, if the Reader will be pleaÅ¿ed to conÅ¿ider the <hi>Texts</hi> of Scripture that are Å¿ubjoyned to the Title page. In which he doth Å¿ecretly Å¿eem to inÅ¿inuate (for to what purpoÅ¿e elÅ¿e are they there put?) That becauÅ¿e he is not Å¿uffered to preach any longer at <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manbury</hi> (upon juÅ¿t cauÅ¿es hereafter to be mentioned) That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Truth is fallen in the Å¿treets, and equity cannot enter.</hi> That therefore, <hi>We are a rebellious people, lying children, that will not hear the Word of the Lord, who Å¿ay to the Prophets, PropheÅ¿ie not right things.</hi> And like to <hi>the Scribes and PhariÅ¿ees, who commanded Peter, Iames and Iohn not to teach in the Name of ChriÅ¿t.</hi> Now whether this be not a perverting of Scripture, and an unparallel'd affront to <hi>Alderman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> we leave it unto the unbiaÅ¿Å¿ed Reader to determine. In the laÅ¿t text he juÅ¿tifieth himÅ¿elf, in the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 20.27. which puts us in minde of a <hi>Book</hi> written by him of his life and Å¿ufferings, wherein he is pleaÅ¿ed to compare his Å¿ufferings with the Å¿ufferings of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> and in many things to preferre his Å¿ufferings above <hi>Pauls</hi> Å¿ufferings. And yet we doe not write this, as if we would any waies undervalue M. <hi>Burtons</hi> great Å¿ufferings, for which we <hi>bleÅ¿Å¿e God,</hi> and for which we Å¿hall alwaies honour him, and we doe believe that therein he did great Å¿ervice to the Churches of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿us ChriÅ¿t.

            <p>But leaving the <hi>Title</hi> page, let us come to the <hi>Narrative</hi> it Å¿elf.</p>
            <p>In which there are divers things <hi>Å¿uppoÅ¿ed,</hi> and taken for <hi>granted,</hi> which are not to be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed; and many things <hi>miÅ¿reported</hi> and <hi>miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreÅ¿ented.</hi> And therefore that the <hi>Reader</hi> may have the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Å¿et before them in the right colours, we are neceÅ¿Å¿itated to Å¿hew what thoÅ¿e falÅ¿e <hi>Å¿uppoÅ¿itions</hi> and falÅ¿e <hi>repreÅ¿entations</hi> are. And M. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> muÅ¿t not be offended with us for Å¿peaking the truth. We profeÅ¿Å¿e that we write theÅ¿e things with grief of heart. For we know that the <hi>common enemy</hi> will take advantage by our differences; but woe be to him by whom thoÅ¿e offences come. For our parts we declare
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113328:3"/>to all the world, that had it not been that <hi>Truth</hi> would have been quite <hi>Å¿hut out of doors</hi> by our Å¿ilence, we would not have anÅ¿wered this <hi>Narrative</hi> of <hi>Truth Å¿hut out of doors.</hi> But to come to the matter it Å¿elf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. FirÅ¿t, It is taken for granted thorowout the whole <hi>Narrative,</hi> That the Å¿hutting of <hi>Independency</hi> out of doors, is the <hi>Å¿hutting of truth out of doors.</hi> And that the deÅ¿iring of M. <hi>Burton</hi> to forbear to preach his <hi>Congregationall way,</hi> is to deÅ¿ire him to <hi>refrain</hi> from preaching <hi>the truth of God.</hi> And that if M. <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿hould balk this controverÅ¿ie, he Å¿hould <hi>balk a neceÅ¿Å¿ary truth of God,</hi> and Å¿hould <hi>Å¿hut up truth cloÅ¿e pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oner.</hi> And many Å¿uch like expreÅ¿Å¿ions, which will not we hope any whit move a wiÅ¿e and judicious <hi>Reader.</hi> For an opinion is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>truth,</hi> becauÅ¿e M. <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿aith it is. Bold and <hi>confident aÅ¿Å¿ertions</hi> may work upon thoÅ¿e that have mens perÅ¿ons in admiration: but a wiÅ¿e and underÅ¿tanding <hi>ChriÅ¿tian</hi> will conÅ¿ider not Å¿o much who Å¿peaks, nor the confidence of him that Å¿peaks, as the weight and Å¿trength of the arguments upon which his confidence is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There was an <hi>Athenian</hi> that laid confident claim to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Å¿hip that came to the haven, and yet he had no true right to any, and was accounted a mad man for his labour. The reformed <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> know no Å¿uch <hi>truths of God.</hi> An he himÅ¿elf (we believe) hath not been many years of this judgement. But howÅ¿oever let not M. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> aÅ¿Å¿ume Å¿uch a high meaÅ¿ure of confidence to himÅ¿elf, as to make his judgement, and the <hi>truths of God</hi> to be <hi>terms convertible.</hi> The world is too wiÅ¿e to believe any Å¿uch thing. And many will Å¿ay that this is <hi>Å¿elf worÅ¿hip</hi> and <hi>Å¿elf-idolatry.</hi>

Secondly, M. <hi>Burton</hi> doth take it for granted, <hi>That he is bound to preach every truth of God that comes in his way,</hi> in this his Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticall Lecture; and <hi>that he is not to Å¿hut up any truth cloÅ¿e priÅ¿oner</hi> (as his phraÅ¿e is) <hi>And he bleÅ¿Å¿eth God that the Committee when they met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not one of them did uÅ¿e a word of perÅ¿waÅ¿ion to him to balk any one truth in opening and plowing up the Scriptures.</hi> But we are informed by Å¿ome of the Committee, that upon his firÅ¿t admiÅ¿Å¿ion to this Lecture, he was deÅ¿ired not to meddle with the points in controverÅ¿ie (which he is pleaÅ¿ed to call the <hi>truths of God</hi>) And that he did promiÅ¿e Å¿o to do, or at leaÅ¿t by his Å¿ilence gave his conÅ¿ent. And we can upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> certain grounds aÅ¿Å¿ure the <hi>Reader,</hi> that M. <hi>Burtons</hi> medling with the points in difference is much diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ing to moÅ¿t of them, who profeÅ¿Å¿e that they will not countenance him, nor maintain him in it. And that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113328:4"/>they Å¿ent one of their Committee to M. <hi>Burton,</hi> Å¿ince his Å¿aid Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture ceaÅ¿ed, to perÅ¿wade him to deÅ¿iÅ¿t from preaching his Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent opinions amongÅ¿t us. And therefore we wonder that M. <hi>Burton</hi> durÅ¿t write after Å¿uch a manner concerning the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee. HowÅ¿oever, if M. <hi>Burton</hi> will yet perÅ¿evere in this his reÅ¿olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this be alÅ¿o the judgement of his brethren (as we hope it is not) mark the miÅ¿chiefs that muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily follow hereupon.</p>
            <p n="1">1 All underwriters, that are not Independents in their judgments, muÅ¿t be forced to Å¿tudy this caÅ¿e of conÅ¿cience, <hi>Whether they can with a Å¿afe conÅ¿cience contribute to the maintenance of that Lecturer, which is engaged in his conÅ¿cience to preach up that opinion which they think diÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Word of God, whenÅ¿oever it comes in his way?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This miÅ¿chief alÅ¿o will follow, That all Presbyterian MiniÅ¿ters, in whoÅ¿e Churches theÅ¿e our brethren preach, with Å¿uch a reÅ¿olution made known, muÅ¿t either by their Å¿ilence be acceÅ¿Å¿ary to the miÅ¿gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their people, or by confuting them, make their Pulpits pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Å¿trife and contention, to the great diÅ¿turbance of piety &amp; peace, or do a third thing which will not be very pleaÅ¿ing to them or us.</p>
            <p>But it Å¿eems Å¿trange to us, that M. <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿hould thinke himÅ¿elf bound to preach his particular opinion in every Congregation: And that all truths (as he cals them) are to be preached at all times, in all places. Is it not Å¿ufficient to preach his private judgement to his own gathered Church, but he muÅ¿t think himÅ¿elf bound in conÅ¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to come to infect (for Å¿o we judge it) all Congregations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever he comes? If this Å¿hould be the principle likewiÅ¿e (which God forbid) of all his brethren, let the wiÅ¿e Reader conÅ¿ider what a City-devouring fire this principle would quickly kindle.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, M. <hi>Burton</hi> doth take it for granted, that he did preach no otherwiÅ¿e, <hi>Sept.</hi> 23. 1645. then is Å¿et down in the <hi>Narrative.</hi> But certainly, if he had preached only, as he Å¿aith, againÅ¿t <hi>man worÅ¿hip,</hi> and <hi>will-worÅ¿hip, blinde obedience</hi> and <hi>reÅ¿ting finally</hi> upon mens deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations in matters of religion, without looking into the rule of the Word; thoÅ¿e of us that heard him, would not have taken the leaÅ¿t offence at it: For we have often, and often heard the Å¿ame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from our own MiniÅ¿ter. And therefore we think it very raÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done of him, to charge M. <hi>Calamy, That he Å¿hould in the face of God, and of the Congregation, bring this truth as a grievous Å¿in to be bewailed:</hi> for he cannot but know that this is very unlikely, if not impoÅ¿Å¿ible to be true.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:113328:4"/>
            <p>But there are divers others beÅ¿ides the PariÅ¿h Clerk (as M. <hi>Burton</hi> by way of Å¿corn cals him) that are ready to depoÅ¿e, that he did preach otherwiÅ¿e then is Å¿et down in his <hi>Narrative.</hi> And here we cannot but take notice how BiÅ¿hop-like he lords it over the poor PariÅ¿h Clerk, telling us of a <hi>garment of many peeces patch'd together.</hi> But Å¿urely it doth ill become his <hi>gravity</hi> to jeaÅ¿t at a mans calling, and worÅ¿e become his <hi>goodnes</hi> to trample a poor godly man thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his foot. And let the Reader judge, whether this diÅ¿courÅ¿e of the PariÅ¿h Clerk were not Å¿ewed into the Narrative, as an old patch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new garment, for it comes in very abruptly. But to the buÅ¿ines. There are thoÅ¿e amongÅ¿t us, that will depoÅ¿e that M. <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿aid, <hi>That for a people to wait upon man for a form to worÅ¿hip God by, was Idolatry.</hi> Nay, <hi>For a people to wait upon Parliament or AÅ¿Å¿embly, for a form to worÅ¿hip God by, was worÅ¿e then corporall Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But, Å¿aith M. <hi>Burton</hi> in his conference with M. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Will you not give credit to me, as well as to thoÅ¿e that informed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t me?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> If he Å¿aith, That theÅ¿e things are not in his notes, or that he intended not to preach thus, we will believe him. But if M. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Å¿aith directly, <hi>He did not preach thus;</hi> We conceive it a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿afe thing for a man to affirm a <hi>Negative,</hi> when three or four will witneÅ¿Å¿e the <hi>Affirmative.</hi> One that heard him at that time, tells, that when he Å¿aid, <hi>Mistake me not,</hi> he added preÅ¿ently, <hi>I Å¿corn mistakes.</hi> And the party perceived he began a little to be angry. And a man in a paÅ¿Å¿ion may Å¿ay that which was not in his Notes. But if he thinks this harÅ¿h dealing, let him but review his <hi>Narrative,</hi> and conÅ¿ider how he deals with M. <hi>Calamy,</hi> believing and publiÅ¿hing to all the world what he collected out of his Sermon, but from one man, who is one, as we hear, of his own Congregation; whereas we have witneÅ¿Å¿e, more then one, for what we Å¿ay. And alÅ¿o not believing that M. <hi>Calamy</hi> was not acquainted with his <hi>Å¿hutting out</hi> (as he cals it) though the <hi>Church-wardens</hi> came on purpoÅ¿e to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him of it. And though he himÅ¿elf affirmed it to him: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ãâã</desc>
               </gap> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference he had with him, and though he hath no witneÅ¿Å¿e to prove the contrary. So great is his uncharitableneÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, It is taken for granted, that M. <hi>Calamy</hi> in his FaÅ¿t Sermon, <hi>Septemb.</hi> 24, 1645. did call upon his people to be aÅ¿hamed and confounded, as for divers other things, Å¿o amongÅ¿t the reÅ¿t for this, <hi>That whileÅ¿t the Parliament is Å¿itting, and labouring to Å¿ettle
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113328:5"/>things, and while the AÅ¿Å¿embly of Ministers are studying to Å¿ettle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and labouring to heal our breaches, Å¿hould be Å¿eparating from us;</hi> Thus much he confeÅ¿Å¿eth he Å¿aid. But now whereas it is added he Å¿hould Å¿ay,
<note place="margin">And that you may be Å¿ure your Scribe did miÅ¿take M. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamies</hi> Sermon, conÅ¿ider that one paÅ¿Å¿age, though of no great conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. M. <hi>Calamie</hi> Å¿aid, Is not this to croud people <hi>into Å¿eparated Congregations?</hi> And your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary hath it, <hi>Into Å¿ecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.</hi>
               </note> That this is a Å¿in to be aÅ¿hamed for, <hi>That while a houÅ¿e is a purging, men Å¿hould Å¿eparate from the defilements, and not waite to Å¿ee what the purging will be.</hi> He conceives this to be either the wilfull, or ignorant miÅ¿take of his <hi>Notary.</hi> And he deÅ¿ires M. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> would name another witneÅ¿Å¿e, if he can: For the ApoÅ¿tle Å¿aith, Receive not an accuÅ¿ation againÅ¿t an Elder, under two or three witneÅ¿Å¿es. He never thought, much leÅ¿Å¿e preached, that we Å¿hould joyne with a <hi>defiled Church in her defilements.</hi> It is one thing to joyne with a <hi>Church</hi> in her corruptions: Another thing to Å¿epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from a true Church, becauÅ¿e of Å¿ome <hi>defilements</hi> that may be in it. And this is that for which we thinke people ought to be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hamed and confounded;</hi> BecauÅ¿e for Å¿ome few, (and thoÅ¿e but Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed) defilements they <hi>Å¿eparate</hi> not onely from <hi>defilements,</hi> but from the true <hi>Churches of JeÅ¿us Christ,</hi> and ingage themÅ¿elves into Å¿eparated Congregations, and doe not waite and tarry to Å¿ee what <hi>Reformation</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> will make. And this is no more then five (as we remember) of your brethren have written, as their judgement in print. And therefore what M. <hi>Burton</hi> writes in his margin, to prove <hi>that every one ought to day, before to morrow, to Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from preÅ¿ent defilements,</hi> is but to fight with his own Å¿hadow. For though we muÅ¿t Å¿eparate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the <hi>defilements of a Church,</hi> yet we are not to Å¿eparate from a <hi>Church,</hi> for every <hi>defilement</hi> that is in it. The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had many defilements in it, as many we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as the Church of <hi>Alderman-bury;</hi> And Å¿o had divers of the Churches to which ChriÅ¿t wrote. And yet neither ChriÅ¿t, nor his ApoÅ¿tles doth perÅ¿wade the people to Å¿eparate from thoÅ¿e Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, becauÅ¿e of the defilements. And if this doctrine were true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, we believe men will Å¿oon finde cauÅ¿e to Å¿eparate from Å¿ome of their Churches,
<note place="margin">A letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by M John Batchelor.</note> as well as ours. The time was when in print, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Alderman-bury</hi> was accounted a <hi>true Church,</hi> even by one of his owne way. And we can aÅ¿Å¿ure him, That it is much purer now, then it was then.</p>
            <p>But he addes in his Margin. <hi>That each man in his place, and each MiniÅ¿ter in his place, muÅ¿t forthwithfall to a purging out the defilements, not knowing, what others purging may prove to be, and how long we may waite, when in the interim we and our houÅ¿e may periÅ¿h in our defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:113328:5"/>But to this we anÅ¿wer.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, That we would gladly know what theÅ¿e <hi>defilements</hi> are, that he Å¿aith are Å¿till in our <hi>Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, How will he prove that theÅ¿e <hi>defilements</hi> are of Å¿uch a <hi>Å¿oul-deÅ¿troying</hi> nature, that they that live in them, muÅ¿t <hi>neceÅ¿Å¿arily periÅ¿h?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Doth he not directly tell us in this paÅ¿Å¿age, That we muÅ¿t not waite to Å¿ee what <hi>Reformation</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> will make? And is not this an unexpreÅ¿Å¿ible prejudice to their proceedings?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is our opinion, That every MiniÅ¿ter, and every man ought Å¿o to adminiÅ¿ter, and Å¿o to partake of Gods ordinances, as not to Å¿in in the adminiÅ¿tration, and participation of them. And this they ought to doe to day, before to morrow. But we conceive, and, if it were a fit oportunity, would prove, that this may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Å¿eparation</hi> from us. It is one thing to keep our Å¿elves <hi>pure from pollution,</hi> another thing to gather <hi>Churches out of Churches,</hi> and to Å¿et up a <hi>new frame of Government,</hi> according to the private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>MiniÅ¿ter</hi> and people of every particular Church. This we conceive to be his practice, and of dangerous conÅ¿equence; and for this we thinke he hath no warrant in the Word, but that he ought to waite yet longer upon the <hi>Magistrates eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment.</hi> The Scripture gives much power to MagiÅ¿trates, in purging of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, when corrupted: As we may perceive by the examples of <hi>AÅ¿a, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>JoÅ¿iah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we are very glad to reade in his Margin, that he makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Å¿olemne League and Covenant.</hi> And we hope he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he hath Å¿worne to indeavour the <hi>extirpation of HereÅ¿y, SchiÅ¿me, and profaneneÅ¿Å¿e, and to bring the Churches of God, in the three Kingdomes, to the neerest conjunction and uniformity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Burton</hi> goeth on in repeating M. <hi>Calamies</hi> Å¿ermon, according as his one onely witneÅ¿Å¿e did dictate unto him. And he Å¿aith, That he preached that we Å¿hould likewiÅ¿e be aÅ¿hamed and confounded, that any Å¿hould preach, <hi>That it is Idolatry to waite upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or AÅ¿Å¿embly, and that it is above all corporall Idolatry, to waite upon them till they Å¿ettle a Government.</hi> And here he triumphs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and inÅ¿ults, (Å¿uch is his Å¿pirit) as much over M. <hi>Calamy,</hi> as he did before over the PariÅ¿h Clerke. He Å¿aith, <hi>he hopes that</hi> M. Calamy <hi>will in his next Å¿olemne day of Humiliation, finde juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to confeÅ¿Å¿e, Let us be aÅ¿hamed and confounded.</hi> And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113328:6"/>part of his Narrative, Å¿peaking of the Å¿ame thing, he Å¿aith, <hi>O that I might heare a Å¿econd voice in Alderman-bury pulpit, and that on the like Å¿olemne FaÅ¿t day; Let us be aÅ¿hamed and confounded, that we have bin aÅ¿hamed of the truth, more precious then our lives, and have Å¿hut it ourt of doors,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But let M. <hi>Burton</hi> tell us, whether he be in jeÅ¿t or in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿t. Doth he think that any meek, or humble ChriÅ¿tian, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of this language? For our parts we will not cenÅ¿ure him, but mourne for him. Doth he not thinke that this is a Å¿inne to be bewailed, that it Å¿hould be preached, <hi>That it is worÅ¿e then corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Idolatry, to waite upon the Parliament, to Å¿ee what Government they will Å¿ettle?</hi> Is this Doctrine a <hi>Truth more precious then our lives?</hi> Is this doctrine a cleare and undoubted truth? For Å¿o much he Å¿eems to Å¿ay in expreÅ¿Å¿e termes in his <hi>Narrative,</hi> in theÅ¿e wordsâ;<hi>And being at the very worst, a clear and undoubted truth:</hi> which words we cannot but wonder at, and we believe when the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ponders them, he will Å¿tand amazed at them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But M. <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿aith, That he did not preach as it is here Å¿et down.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AnÅ¿w.</hi> But to this it is anÅ¿wered. 1. That now he owns it as it is heere Å¿et down as a clear and an undoubted truth. 2. That M. <hi>Calamy</hi> did not name him by name. But to this he replieth in his conference with M. <hi>Calamy, That he needed not to name you, for all that heard both you and me, underÅ¿tand plainly enough, you did mean me, Å¿o freÅ¿h it is in memory.</hi> But in this anÅ¿wer of his he doth Å¿eem ingenuouÅ¿ly to confeÅ¿Å¿e, that he Å¿aid the words he denyed he Å¿aid. For if he Å¿aid no Å¿uch thing, and Å¿pake nothing in derogation ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Parliament or AÅ¿Å¿embly, but made honourable mention of both; How is it poÅ¿Å¿ible that they that heard him, and M. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Å¿hould Å¿uppoÅ¿e that M. <hi>Calamy</hi> meant him? This very anÅ¿wer of his, doth Å¿eem to confeÅ¿Å¿e a guiltineÅ¿Å¿e. But to put him out of doubt, it is anÅ¿wered. 3. That M. <hi>Calamy</hi> hath good proof of others that have preached to this effect, though he had not. And therefore had juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to Å¿ay Å¿o, although he had not preached at all the day before. It is no wonder to heare men preach up their own practice. No wonder to heare thoÅ¿e men preach againÅ¿t peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples tarrying to gather into Å¿eparated Churches, who daily gather people into Å¿eparated Churches.</p>
            <p>But he deeply chargeth M. <hi>Calamy</hi> in divers places of his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113328:6"/>becauÅ¿e he did not Å¿end to him to know the truth of thoÅ¿e things, whether he preached them or no, before he Å¿pake of them in the pulpit.</p>
            <p>But it is anÅ¿wered. That if indeed no other had ever preached to the Å¿ame effect, or if he had named M. <hi>Burton</hi> by name, or if he had Å¿aid it had bin preached in that pulpit the day before, or if it had bin preached in another Church before other people, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there might be Å¿ome ground and reaÅ¿on for this accuÅ¿ation.</p>
            <p>But Å¿eeing that others have preached the like, and M. <hi>Burton was not named,</hi> and that it was about a Å¿ermon preached in his own <hi>Church,</hi> before Å¿ome of his own people, of whoÅ¿e faithfulneÅ¿Å¿e he had no reaÅ¿on to doubt: And Å¿eeing it was onely Å¿poken in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall way, M. <hi>Burtons</hi> applying of it to himÅ¿elf, doth give us juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to thinke that he was guilty of it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is taken for granted, that the Church-wardens Å¿aid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to M. <hi>Burton, That they were Å¿orry for what they had done, if they had done amiÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> But they Å¿ay that they did not Å¿ay, that they were Å¿orry for the <hi>thing</hi> they had done, but only for Å¿ome <hi>circumÅ¿tances</hi> about the manner of doing of it. And they doe now further tell him, that upon diligent Å¿earch made, they cannot finde out by whoÅ¿e authority and allowance he firÅ¿t came to preach his Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiÅ¿ticall lecture amongÅ¿t them. M. <hi>Calamy</hi> Å¿aith, That none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Å¿pake to him, to deÅ¿ire his conÅ¿ent. And our former Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens deny, that ever they gave their approbation. <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they Å¿uppoÅ¿e, he hath no Å¿uch cauÅ¿e to take it ill, if they upon juÅ¿t grounds forbid him to doe that which he never had warrant, nor autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from them to doe at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, And eÅ¿pecially M. <hi>Burton</hi> takes it as a thing Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, that his Å¿ermon preached <hi>Sept.</hi> 23. 1645. was the <hi>cauÅ¿e,</hi> and the <hi>onely cauÅ¿e</hi> why he was deÅ¿ired to forbear preaching at <hi>Alderman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> Whereas this Å¿ermon was rather an <hi>occaÅ¿ion</hi> then a <hi>cauÅ¿e;</hi> And if a <hi>cauÅ¿e,</hi> yet not the <hi>onely</hi> nor <hi>chief cauÅ¿e.</hi> The Reader muÅ¿t know, that M. <hi>Burton</hi> hath often and often preached his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinion of <hi>Independency,</hi> in his Lecture at <hi>Alderman bury,</hi> to the great offence and Å¿candall of Å¿ome of us, that have hereupon reÅ¿olved never to heare him more, becauÅ¿e we heard Å¿uch things, which as we thought, were contrary to truth. And therefore M. <hi>Burton</hi> need not wonder <hi>what Å¿pirit haunted thoÅ¿e wals and thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿holds, that Å¿o few people came to heare him in that place.</hi> Surely it was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113328:7"/>the <hi>spirit of errour</hi> that <hi>haunted</hi> them, and drove them away. For Å¿ometimes (as we are informed by thoÅ¿e of our own Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that heard him) he would urge <hi>a neceÅ¿Å¿ity of entring into a Church-way,</hi> and that there <hi>is no expectation of Å¿alvation without it.</hi> And that it was <hi>as neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be joyned in Church-fellowÅ¿hip, as with ChriÅ¿t the head.</hi> Another time, <hi>That a member that walks out of Church-fellowÅ¿hip is unuÅ¿efull to it Å¿elf,</hi> as if a foot and a leg be out of joynt, it is unuÅ¿eful: for any that walks Å¿ingly and alone, without being in Communion and in a Church-way, <hi>He is out of the body of ChriÅ¿t, and Å¿o is unuÅ¿efull to himÅ¿elf and others.</hi> Again, <hi>You complain you grow not in grace: but joyn in a Church-way, here is growth in grace. A member out of his proper place growes not.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, <hi>That none ought to be admitted to the Supper of the Lord, but Å¿uch as were entred into a Church-way, and had covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Congregationall-way.</hi> And that <hi>none could receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aright, that had not firÅ¿t taken the Church-covenant.</hi> And <hi>that to joyn in a Church-way, is more then to be a ProteÅ¿tant at large, becauÅ¿e they ought to watch over one another, and thoÅ¿e that refuÅ¿ed to joyn, were as</hi> Cain, <hi>that are ready to Å¿ay,</hi> Am I my brothers keeper? They that wrote his Sermons do alÅ¿o tell us, <hi>That he made Å¿undry Sermons to preÅ¿Å¿e the neceÅ¿Å¿ity of gathering Churches, and covenanting together.</hi> They tell us likewiÅ¿e that he Å¿hewed <hi>how dangerous it was for men to Å¿et up Churches Provinciall, Nationall, or Parochiall. This was An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriÅ¿tian and BabyloniÅ¿h, Å¿et up by the Pope, that all in a PariÅ¿h might come to MaÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> Another time he Å¿pake againÅ¿t paying of Tithes, as PopiÅ¿h, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such things as theÅ¿e he often and often, as occaÅ¿ion Å¿erved, did not Å¿pare to preach and urge with great vehemency: InÅ¿omuch as many of us, and others of the City did reÅ¿ort to M. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy,</hi> and told him that they wondered how he could with a Å¿afe conÅ¿cience Å¿uffer Å¿uch things to be preached, which they knew to be Å¿o contrary to his judgement. Upon this M. <hi>Calamy</hi> at one time got a reverend <hi>MiniÅ¿ter</hi> of M. <hi>Burtons</hi> acquaintance to go to him, and to deal mildly with him about theÅ¿e things, and to repreÅ¿ent the Å¿can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of the people. But all the anÅ¿wer, as he remembers, returned was, that M. <hi>Burton thought himÅ¿elf ingaged to preach the kingdom of ChriÅ¿t.</hi> Upon another time M. <hi>Calamy</hi> did likewiÅ¿e Å¿peak to one of his brethren of that way about it, and all the anÅ¿wer to his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t remembrance that he had, was this, M. <hi>Calamy, you know the man, and of what nature he is, it is in vain to speak to him, he will doe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113328:7"/>what he liÅ¿t: And it may be he preacheth thus to Å¿ee whether you will cast him out, or no.</hi> At another time M. <hi>Calamy</hi> Å¿pake with another of the brethren of that way; and his advice was, <hi>To get a meeting of M.</hi> Burton, <hi>and the reÅ¿t of his brethren, and they would Å¿ee if they could perÅ¿wade him to deÅ¿iÅ¿t from preaching his Church-way in Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manbury.</hi> But notwithÅ¿tanding all this, M. <hi>Burton</hi> continued in his TueÅ¿day Lecture, upon all occaÅ¿ions promoting his Congregational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, till at laÅ¿t, upon occaÅ¿ion of his Sermon, <hi>Septemb.</hi> 23. 1645. The Church-wardens Å¿ent to him the day before he was to preach, to forbear preaching any more at <hi>Aldermanbury.</hi> And this they did without acquainting M. <hi>Calamy</hi> with it, whatÅ¿oever M. <hi>Burton</hi> thinks to the contrary. Of which, as Å¿oon as M. <hi>Calamy</hi> heard, he Å¿ent for the Church-wardens, and obtained of them upon the <hi>TueÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> morning (which was the next day after) to go to M. <hi>Burton,</hi> and to declare the whole truth to him, how it Å¿tood, That M. <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> was a Å¿tranger to the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e: That upon M. <hi>Calamies</hi> intreaty they came to him, aÅ¿Å¿uring of him that if he would be pleaÅ¿ed to forbear the points in difference, and to preach <hi>JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t,</hi> and him crucified, the doctrines of faith, repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and cheerfully Å¿uffer him to preach. But he anÅ¿wered, as it is Å¿et down in the Narrative, <hi>That he was not to be reÅ¿trained from preaching any truth of God.</hi> Now let all indifferent Readers judge, whether M. <hi>Burton</hi> by his former practices, and his laÅ¿t anÅ¿wer doth not <hi>willingly and wilfully Å¿hut himÅ¿elf out of the Church doors of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For though he Å¿uppoÅ¿eth his Congregationall-way to be the <hi>truth of God,</hi> yet it is never the more the <hi>truth of God,</hi> becauÅ¿e he Å¿uppoÅ¿eth it. And if he thinke it his duty to preach thoÅ¿e truths (which we thinke errours) in <hi>Aldermanbury: The Å¿ame conÅ¿ciences that obligeth him to preach thoÅ¿e truths, will oblige M.</hi> Calamy, <hi>who thinks them errours, to preach againÅ¿t them.</hi> And by this means the courÅ¿e and fruits of his MiniÅ¿tery will be much hindered, and the Pulpit made a Å¿tage of contention, and to Å¿peak uncertain Å¿ounds; one thing upon the <hi>TueÅ¿day,</hi> another upon the <hi>Lords day. We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to M.</hi> Burton, <hi>whether ever he did, or ever will give leave to a PreÅ¿byterian MiniÅ¿ter to preach his PreÅ¿byterian opinions to his people, that he hath gathered? Or if any Å¿hould occaÅ¿ionally preach them to his people, whether he would not thinke himÅ¿elf bound in conÅ¿cience to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them?</hi> We demand further, <hi>Whether he doth not thinke it his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113328:8"/>to hinder (as farre as he can) that a PreÅ¿byterian MiniÅ¿ter, reÅ¿ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to preach his way (as Å¿uppoÅ¿ing it the truth of ChriÅ¿t) Å¿hould be Å¿uffered to preach once a fortnight to his people. And whether, if he Å¿hould be a means to hinder it, he can be Å¿aid to Å¿hut Truth out of doors?</hi> Let M. <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿eriouÅ¿ly Å¿tudy theÅ¿e queÅ¿tions, and not thinke it hard meaÅ¿ure, that he is not Å¿uffered to doe that in <hi>Aldermanbury,</hi> which he would not Å¿uffer to be done in his own Congregation.</p>
            <p>But further, we would have him to know, that they that are for the <hi>PreÅ¿byterian government,</hi> do firmly believe that that which they hold hath clear light out of the Scriptures, &amp; that they are able to prove it: and that the Congregational-way is an invention of man: and that there is no Word of God for a <hi>Church-covenant: for gathering Churches out of Churches;</hi> for <hi>aÅ¿Å¿uming all Church power within themÅ¿elves independently:</hi> And that this is a way and means to divide the body of ChriÅ¿t into as many Å¿chiÅ¿mes, as there be Congregations. And he muÅ¿t not thinke that the <hi>PreÅ¿byterian MiniÅ¿ters</hi> are Å¿o void of a good <hi>conÅ¿cience,</hi> Å¿o <hi>cruell</hi> to the <hi>Å¿ouls</hi> of their people, Å¿o <hi>aÅ¿hamed</hi> of the <hi>truths</hi> they hold, as to Å¿uffer them to be trampled under feet, and their people to be Å¿educed by one that Å¿hall preach in their own Pulpits, with a profeÅ¿Å¿ion to preach down the Presbyteriall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they in the mean time Å¿it quiet, and betray the truth, and their people by their wicked Å¿ilence.</p>
            <p>Adde to this what was Å¿aid before about the Committee, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other things fore-mentioned, and then it will appear to all peaceable and unprejudiced Readers, that there is juÅ¿t cauÅ¿e that M. <hi>Burton,</hi> continuing in this minde and judgement, Å¿hould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his Lecture at <hi>Aldermanbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. The Å¿eventh thing that is miÅ¿-repreÅ¿ented and miÅ¿-Å¿tated, is, the conference that was between M. <hi>Burton</hi> and M. <hi>Calamy</hi> in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. Of which that there may be a right and full repreÅ¿enta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Reader muÅ¿t know, That when M. <hi>Calamy</hi> perceived by M. <hi>Burtons</hi> anÅ¿wer upon the TueÅ¿day, that he was reÅ¿olved not to ceaÅ¿e preaching the points in difference (and as one very neer him, told Å¿ome of us, that M. <hi>Burton</hi> would not be <hi>muzled up</hi>) he Å¿adly weighed all things that might happen hereupon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the one Å¿ide</hi> he conÅ¿idered, that in this uncharitable age, even good people would be ready to cenÅ¿ure him very deeply (though never Å¿o innocent) and charge him as the chief, if not the Å¿ole an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of what was done, and that the times were too too full of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ions
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113328:8"/>already, and that there was little need of new rents and Å¿chiÅ¿mes. And therefore he concluded with himÅ¿elfe to doe all that he could with a Å¿afe conÅ¿cience for M. <hi>Burtons</hi> re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the other Å¿ide,</hi> he conÅ¿idered, That this was done without his privity or knowledge, and that the hand of God was in it, and that if now he Å¿hould be inÅ¿trumentall for his re-admiÅ¿Å¿ion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a promiÅ¿e, or at leaÅ¿t a fair overture upon good ground (for he did not expect a formall promiÅ¿e) That M. <hi>Burton</hi> would preach only Å¿uch things wherein they did both agree, he Å¿hould for the time to come be acceÅ¿Å¿ary to all the miÅ¿chiefs that might happen, if any of his people Å¿hould either be led away, or if not quite led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yet puzled and enÅ¿nared by what M. <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿hould preach. And this his Å¿cruple was the more encreaÅ¿ed, becauÅ¿e M. <hi>Burton</hi> had already taken one of his Congregation into his Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever acquainting him with it (which is Å¿urely a great injury to M. <hi>Calamy,</hi> and Å¿o great, as that we have good cauÅ¿e to beleeve, that few of his brethren would have done the like.) By this he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that M. <hi>Burton</hi> was reÅ¿olved to catch (we will not Å¿ay, to Å¿teal) as many as he could from his Church. Now here was the <hi>caÅ¿e of conÅ¿cience, How far he might be active in M.</hi> Burtons <hi>re-admiÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> He conÅ¿ulted with godly, learned. He was told, <hi>That as things then Å¿tood, he could not with a Å¿afe conÅ¿cience intreat for his re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion, unleÅ¿Å¿e he had Å¿ome ground to believe that M.</hi> Burton <hi>would not preach his Congregationall-way amongÅ¿t his people.</hi> Upon this the WedneÅ¿day after this TueÅ¿day, M. <hi>Francis Shute</hi> comming to viÅ¿it M. <hi>Calamy,</hi> who was Å¿ick, M. <hi>Calamy</hi> communicated the whole buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e to him, and deÅ¿ired him to relate it to the Committee, that they might have a right underÅ¿tanding of it, and to endeavour that the Committee might uÅ¿e their intereÅ¿t in M. <hi>Burton</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him to forbear the points in difference, that Å¿o he might bere admitted. How farre M. <hi>Francis Shute</hi> did manifeÅ¿t his diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of M. <hi>Burtons</hi> medling with his Congregationall way in his preaching at Aldermanbury, we will not relate. But as M. <hi>Calamy</hi> conceives, upon M. <hi>Shutes</hi> applying himÅ¿elf to the Committee, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the conference Å¿poken of in the Narrative. For M. <hi>Shute</hi> came afterwards and told him that M. <hi>Burton</hi> would come to him. But he replied, That as Å¿oon as he was well he would go to M. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> But M. <hi>Burton</hi> prevented him.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:113328:9"/>
            <p>Little did M. <hi>Calamy</hi> think that Å¿uch a private conference Å¿hould have been made publike, and cryed up and down the City, and therefore he had no witneÅ¿Å¿e on his Å¿ide to atteÅ¿t what he Å¿aid. But Å¿eeing it is the will of God to have it Å¿o, and to Å¿uffer the fire of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to kindle more and more, let the pious and peaceable Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er read over the conference, and then tell us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether moÅ¿t of the conference be not already anÅ¿wered: Whether it doth not miÅ¿-repreÅ¿ent the whole buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, and take the Å¿ix things before named for granted, which we have abundantly proved to be far otherwiÅ¿e.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether in this conference M. <hi>Burton</hi> doth not diÅ¿cover an <hi>EpiÅ¿copall Å¿pirit,</hi> rather then M. <hi>Calamy.</hi> Indeed M. <hi>Calamy</hi> did not enumerate the particular things, for which we took offence at Å¿ome of M. <hi>Burtons</hi> Sermons: but the reaÅ¿on was, becauÅ¿e he was deÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to <hi>accommodate</hi> and <hi>reconcile</hi> differences, and not to increaÅ¿e them. And this was the reaÅ¿on likewiÅ¿e, why his Clerk was not Å¿ent for, becauÅ¿e, as M. <hi>Francis Shute</hi> then Å¿aid, it would but increaÅ¿e the conteÅ¿t between M. <hi>Burton</hi> and him, and make the breach wider.</p>
            <p>Adde further, That M. <hi>Calamy</hi> thinks that M. <hi>Burton</hi> hath miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed many of his QueÅ¿tions, putting one before another, to the great prejudice of the conference, and interlaced many things, which (as he remembers) M. <hi>Burton</hi> did not Å¿ay at the conference, and hath left out many things that M. <hi>Calamy</hi> did Å¿ay.</p>
            <p>One thing M. <hi>Calamy</hi> chargeth him withall, of which we will give the Reader a fuller account. M. <hi>Calamy</hi> had preached many Sermons out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. concerning brotherly reproof, and the duty of <hi>watching over one another,</hi> and had Å¿hewed that this duty did belong to a ChriÅ¿tian, as a ChriÅ¿tian; not only as he was a <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Church;</hi> and had likewiÅ¿e Å¿hewed how farre they that were members of the Å¿ame Church, were to <hi>watch over one another.</hi> Hereupon he came to juÅ¿tifie an equall and prudent diviÅ¿ion and bounding of Congregations by PariÅ¿hes, that Å¿o by their neer living together, they might the better watch over one another. And then he came to anÅ¿wer that QueÅ¿tion, <hi>Whether the living in the Å¿ame PariÅ¿h did make a man a member of that Church to which his houÅ¿e be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs?</hi> It would be too long to repeat what was anÅ¿wered. But the next TueÅ¿day M. <hi>Burton</hi> preached directly againÅ¿t bounding of Congregations by PariÅ¿hes, Å¿aying, it was <hi>PopiÅ¿h</hi> and <hi>Antichristian,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:113328:9"/>or to that effect, as thoÅ¿e that heard him relate. Vpon this M. <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> when he came again to preach of this Å¿ubject, amongÅ¿t other things wiÅ¿hed that all controverÅ¿ies amongÅ¿t brethren might be laid aÅ¿ide, and that we would agree to preach Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Then comes M. <hi>Burton,</hi> and calleth upon all MiniÅ¿ters to Å¿et up <hi>ChriÅ¿ts Kingdome,</hi> and addes, But Å¿ome will Å¿ay, we muÅ¿t not meddle with theÅ¿e things, but onely <hi>preach faith and repentance.</hi> He anÅ¿wered, <hi>we must not leave out faith and repentance, but we must preach ChriÅ¿ts Kingdome, for we have liberty now to Å¿peak,</hi> &amp;c. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this Å¿tory, M. <hi>Calamy</hi> not naming the Å¿tory, charged M. <hi>Burton</hi> for preaching point blanke againÅ¿t him. And his anÅ¿wer is, <hi>It is poÅ¿Å¿ible I might caÅ¿ually doe Å¿o, yet without reference to you.</hi> Whether this anÅ¿wer be Å¿atisfactory, let the Reader judge. We are Å¿ure that if it be Å¿ufficient, it will quit M. <hi>Calamy</hi> of moÅ¿t of the accuÅ¿ations that are brought againÅ¿t him in the Narrative.</p>
            <p>As for that concerning M. <hi>Lockier,</hi> we Å¿pake Å¿ince with the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tour</hi> of the place where he Lectures, and he aÅ¿Å¿ures us, that it is true that M. <hi>Lockier</hi> hath ingaged himÅ¿elf by promiÅ¿e, not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the point in difference between the Independents and Presbyterians.</p>
            <p>And for M. <hi>Francis Shute,</hi> becauÅ¿e we love and honour him, we will forbear to write what we know. M. <hi>Calamy</hi> remembers not that M. <hi>Hartford</hi> Å¿hould Å¿ay. The Committee thought very hard that theÅ¿e things Å¿hould be Å¿o carried, before M. <hi>Calamy</hi> had firÅ¿t Å¿poken with M. <hi>Burton.</hi> The Committee Å¿urely are wiÅ¿er, then to condemne a man before he be heard. We believe the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee will not own this Å¿peech, much leÅ¿Å¿e thanke him for it.</p>
            <p>Whereas in the later end of the conference M. <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿aith, <hi>that he was Å¿ent home, without any hope of having the doors unlocked, we leaving him without hope of our keeping any truth cloÅ¿e priÅ¿oner.</hi> If theÅ¿e words were well weighed, they would give a <hi>key</hi> to the <hi>Reader</hi> to unlock the whole buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e. M. <hi>Burton</hi> reÅ¿olveth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever he preacheth, to let all truths out of priÅ¿on, and whoÅ¿oever will open the doors of their Church to him, muÅ¿t open their doors to all his Independent opinions alÅ¿o. How farre the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee and the reÅ¿t of the Vnderwriters, and others whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes will approve of this, we know not. But Å¿ure we are, that whoÅ¿oever readeth the <hi>conference,</hi> and this anÅ¿wer to it, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e that M. <hi>Burtons</hi> high language againÅ¿t M. <hi>Calamy,</hi> doth Å¿avour
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113328:10"/>more of Å¿elf-conceitedneÅ¿Å¿e then of juÅ¿t accuÅ¿ation.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The eighth particular which is miÅ¿-related in this Narrative, is about a Å¿econd conference, which, as M. <hi>Burton</hi> Å¿aith, he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of love to Aldermanbury, <hi>There were two of the Committee Å¿ent to M.</hi> Calamy, <hi>to know of him, whether he would be pleaÅ¿ed to Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to exerciÅ¿e there Å¿till: His finall anÅ¿wer to them,</hi> was; <hi>That he could not in conÅ¿cience Å¿uffer me any longer to preach there, becauÅ¿e his people were of a contrary judgment.</hi> Thus farre M. <hi>Burton.</hi> Now that the Reader may underÅ¿tand how farre this Relation is from truth, we will Å¿et down M. <hi>Calamies</hi> anÅ¿wer, as it was written, word for word, by one of thoÅ¿e two, who were Å¿ent to him, and it is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> the firÅ¿t, 1645. M. <hi>Iames Storey,</hi> and M. <hi>Robert Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> were Å¿ent by the Committee to M. <hi>Calamy,</hi> about M. <hi>Burtons</hi> preaching in that Church. And his anÅ¿wer was,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That he had no hand, directly or indirectly, in keeping of him out, and that that buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e lay in the Church-wardens and PariÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That if the Committee will Å¿end under their hands, that they are confident upon good grounds that M.</hi> Burton <hi>will preach the truths of ChriÅ¿t, and not meddle with the controverÅ¿ie, he will be a means to the Church-wardens, and the PariÅ¿hioners for his re-admiÅ¿Å¿ion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this anÅ¿wer it may appear to all the world how deÅ¿irous M. <hi>Calamy</hi> is that M. <hi>Burton</hi> may be reÅ¿tored to his Lecture amongÅ¿t us. And we can further evidence to all that are willing to receive Å¿atisfaction, that M. <hi>Calamy</hi> hath dealt with many of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, and hath made uÅ¿e of one of them in eÅ¿peciall manner to deal with M. <hi>Burton,</hi> to Å¿ee whether he could obtain of him to joyn with M. <hi>Calamy</hi> in a way of peace and unity. But M. <hi>Burton</hi> will either preach all his minde at his Church, or not preach at all. Now whether M <hi>Burton,</hi> or M. <hi>Calamy</hi> be in the fault, let the world judge. And that all men may likewiÅ¿e be fully convinced of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermanburies</hi> love, and good affections towards M. <hi>Burton,</hi> we doe here profeÅ¿Å¿e to all that read theÅ¿e lines, That if M. <hi>Burton</hi> will be pleaÅ¿ed to forbear preaching his Congregationall way amongÅ¿t us, and preach Å¿uch things, wherein both Å¿ides agree, we will re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him with all readineÅ¿Å¿e and cheerfulneÅ¿Å¿e, and will promiÅ¿e to endeavour upon all occaÅ¿ions to come and hear him. Which offer, if <hi>M. Burton</hi> refuÅ¿eth, let the world judge, whether <hi>M. Burton</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:113328:10"/>Å¿huts himÅ¿elf, or be Å¿hut out of the Church-doores of <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we have given an AnÅ¿wer to this <hi>unpleaÅ¿ing Narrative,</hi> Å¿o farre as it concerns us. And it may be the anÅ¿wer will be as <hi>unpleaÅ¿ing</hi> as the Narrative. But our Apology is, <hi>That ours is forc'd, his is voluntary.</hi> It is a Å¿ad thing that <hi>Aldermanbury,</hi> that hath had Å¿o much truth preached unto it, and hath had Å¿o many famous Preachers of truth, Å¿hould now be cried up and down the Å¿treets of the City, as a people that Å¿hut <hi>Truth out of Doors.</hi> Who would not riÅ¿e up to wipe off Å¿uch an aÅ¿perÅ¿ion? <hi>Truth it is the purchaÅ¿e of the blood of IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t: It is that which ChriÅ¿t brought into the world with him: For grace and truth comes by IeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. ChriÅ¿t IeÅ¿us came into the world to bear witneÅ¿Å¿e of the Truth. Truth it is the light and life of the Å¿oul, the SpouÅ¿e of the underÅ¿tanding, the food and Å¿uÅ¿tenance of the Å¿oul: It is to be preferred before gold and Å¿ilver; pearls and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Å¿tones are but dung and droÅ¿Å¿e in compariÅ¿on of it.</hi> And therefore if we contend earneÅ¿tly for the truth, and make it appear to all men, that we are farre from Å¿hutting <hi>Truth out of Doors.</hi> We hope that all that are moderate and Å¿ober ChriÅ¿tians will not only not accuÅ¿e us, but commend us for it. We have done. <hi>The Lord open all the doors of our hearts, that we may receive peace and truth as unÅ¿eparable gueÅ¿ts to lodge within us for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>THere is one thing that M. <hi>Burton</hi> mentioneth in the <hi>Narrative,</hi> which though it concerns not <hi>Aldermanbury,</hi> yet we muÅ¿t not wholly bury it in Å¿ilence, and that is concerning the <hi>late large Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for the Å¿peedy eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment of Religion.</hi> Of which he Å¿peaks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diÅ¿honourably, as alÅ¿o of the Petitioners, as of men led with blinde obedience, and pinning their Å¿ouls upon the <hi>PrieÅ¿ts Å¿leeve.</hi> We leave it to the Petitioners to anÅ¿wer for themÅ¿elves. For our parts we conceive that no Reader, unleÅ¿Å¿e blinded with prejudice, can charge them with blinde obedience.
